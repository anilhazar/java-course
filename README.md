# Java Projects

This repository contains a series of projects designed for learning Java programming. Each project aims to teach a specific concept or topic. Here they are.

1. **Stack Palindrome Words**: This project is developed to learn how to check if a word is a palindrome using the Stack data structure in Java.

2. **Memory Game**: The "Memory Game" project is a Java-based memory card game. It allows players to test their memory by matching pairs of cards on a game board.

3. **Thread Methods**: The "Thread Methods" project demonstrates Java's multithreading capabilities using both the 'extends Thread' and 'implements Runnable' methods.

4. **Executor Service Thread Pool**: The "Executor Service Thread Pool" project showcases how to efficiently manage thread execution with a fixed thread pool using the Executor Service.

5. **Reentrant Lock Await-Signal**: The "Reentrant Lock Await-Signal" project illustrates the usage of the Reentrant Lock with await and signal mechanisms to coordinate threads.

6. **Array Blocking Queue**: The "Array Blocking Queue" project demonstrates the use of a bounded blocking queue to coordinate the producer-consumer pattern in a multithreaded environment.

7. **Beyblade Oyunu**: This project is a Java program that simulates Beyblade battles. You can create and battle with various Beyblades, each having its own unique characteristics and abilities.

8. **Math and Physics Problems**: This project allows you to solve various math and physics problems. You can calculate the area of a circle, the perimeter of a triangle, and perform the dot product of 3D vectors. It's a handy tool for practicing math and physics concepts.
